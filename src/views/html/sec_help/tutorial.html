        <br/>
        <p>First you'll have to authorize the app, you can do that on the auth section of the upper menu.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>After that you can start creating your assets, press ctrl + n or select the new asset option in the file menu. You can select between multiple asset types:</p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Video: upload a video you want to display, change its volume and duration, the default duration value is the length of the entire uploaded video.</li>
            <li>Image/GIF: upload a image you want to display and set its duration.</li>
            <li>Audio: upload a sound or song you want to play, change its volume and duration, the default duration value is the length of the entire uploaded audio.</li>
            <li>Voice: write a text you want to be spoken, set the volume and voice you want to use, the default duration value is equal to the time it takes the text to speech to finish, and the user text parameter specifies if you want the user who redeems the channel points to write the text that will be spoken.</li>
            <li>Youtube: paste a youtube link of the video you want to display, you can change the volume and also the seconds in which it begins and ends, if you don't change the start and end times the video will play from the beginning to the end.</li>
            <li>Text: write a text that you want to be displayed or let the user who redeems choose it be changing the user text parameter, the size parameter is the size of the font measured in pixels, the color parameter must be a hexadecimal value of 6 or 8 digits representing the red, green, blue and alpha channels respectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>The title parameter present in any asset type represents the title of the channel points reward in your channel. You'll have to create a reward and check that the name you gave to it matches the title parameter value in the app.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Once you have all the assets customized the way you want they will appear in the main window where you can delete or edit any of them.</p>
