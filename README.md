<p align="center">Although this is a public repository I recommend everyone not to look at it (yet)</p>

<p><s>This is just a repository to keep track of the versions and use it as a cdn, you can look at the code but I didn't create this with the intention that someone else saw it, the code might be messy.</s></p>
